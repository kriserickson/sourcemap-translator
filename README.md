# Sourcemap Translator 

Tool for viewing errors from sourcemaps, uses [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).

To get working, first install electron (you must have installed [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html first) globally.

```sh
npm install electron-prebuilt -g
```
then simply run app from the downloaded directory:

```sh
electron .
```

Eventually I will probably create binaries of this, but for now this works.
